## Predicting Fatalities from Tornado Data 

- Authors: Erika Delorme, Marcela Flaherty, Riddha Tuladhar, Edwin Yeung

## About 

In our project, we attempt to build a linear regression model that will predict the number of casualties from tornados using the width (yards) and length (miles) of the tornado. 

The data set that was used in this project is from the US NOAA's National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center Severe Weather Maps, Graphics, and Data Page. It was tidied and sourced from TidyTuesday and can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-05-16. 

Each row represents a tornado, along with various features, including width, length, date, time, state in the US, magnitude, financial losses, number of fatalities, number of injuries, etc.
